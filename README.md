# RPJiOS

A [pub/sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern)-based implementation of a 
Raspberry Pi system platform built on [redis](https://redis.io) and centered around sensors.

The general philosophy is that a "sensor" is any entity (physical or not) that operates primarily
in an output-only mode (configuration doesn't necessarily count as an "input" so is allowable).

These outputs are treated ephemerally, in a "fire and forget" manner, creating a data stream.
The intent is for interested entities to subscribe to the data stream and transform, interpret 
and/or persist it according to their requirements.

## Caveat emptor

This is still very much an active work-in-progress, however as it is functional, useful and "deployed" 
(I use it in to run my "garden monitoring bots"), I figured it was worth making public in the event it
might help others in their projects.

## Requirements

* a Raspberry Pi running a recent Raspbian build
	* (not exactly: it should run on any linux OS, and definitely does on any "Debian-like" OS but needs a bit of tweaks to do so. TODO: fix that; it's already running on charlie anyway)
* some sensors, configured appropriately (see below (TODO))
	* depending on your chosen sensors: I2C enabled, SPI enabled (TODO: link to instructions)
* `virtualenv` (python2.7)
* `redis` (running locally, at very least)
* `python-smbus`

## Setup

* Clone the repo
* `cd` into repo dir
* `./setup.sh` (you might need to enter your `sudo` password to install requirements)
* `source env/bin/activate` and go

## Tools

* [sensors-src](bin/sensors-src): source daemon that manages all specified sensors and publishes their data as configured
* [downsample](bin/downsample): a downsampler/transformer(TODO). example uses:
	* an at-frequency forwarder (set `-r 1`)
	* a loopback downsampler (set `-o` to the same as `-i`)
	* a many-to-one reducer (set `-t` to `key`, lots of potential "TODO" here)
* [sqlite-sink](bin/sqlite-sink): an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) sink for data streams. examples:
	* sink to an SQLite database on a different host a downsampled data stream:
		1. on the source device:
			* `downsample -i redis://localhost -o redis://sql-db-host -r ... -p ...`
		2. on the sink host "`sql-db-host`":
			* `sqlite-sink path-to-db.sqlite3`
				* (lots of "TODOs" here, obviously) 
* [oled-display](bin/oled-display): an [OLED display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/661) driver for consuming & display some sensor data, among other things

## Library

### Sensors & Devices

The following are currently supported (with the required drivers / interfaces setup of course):

* [BME680](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/3660/BME680.pdf) temperature / humidity / barometeric pressure / volatic organic compound sensor. My setup uses [AdaFruit's awesome breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) for ease-of-integration. [Source.](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/sensors/BME680.py)
* [DHTXX](https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/737/dht-932870.pdf)(DHT11/DHT22) temperature / humidity sensors. I use [DFRobot's](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1102.html) [breakouts](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-174.html) but you can find similar breakout's from many (re)sellers online. [Source.](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/sensors/DHTXX.py)
* [DS18S20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18S20.pdf) high-precision 1-wire temperature sensor. [Source.](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/sensors/DS18S20.py)
* [LM335](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm335.pdf) precision analog temperature sensor. [Source.](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/sensors/LM335.py)
* Capacative soil moisture sensors such as the DFRobot [SEN0114](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-599.html) or any [simple-to-build capactive analog moisture sensor](http://gardenbot.org/howTo/soilMoisture/). [Source.](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/sensors/Soil.py)
* [TEPT5700](https://www.vishay.com/docs/81321/tept5700.pdf) ambient light sensor.

Variants of these sensors could likely be made to work with this system via simple modifications if any are required at all.

Additionally, a simple Python driver for the [74HC595](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf) 8-bit shift register is included [here](https://github.com/rpj/rpi/blob/master/lib/rpjios/devices/74HC595.py).

* [RPJiOS-Web](https://github.com/rpj/rpjios-web): A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web frontend currently deployed as [rpjios.com](http://rpjios.com) on [Heroku](http://heroku.com)
	* Demonstrates the use of the `-t key` passthru mode of `downsample`, e.g.:
		* `downsample -t 'key' -i 'redis://localhost' -o 'redis://REDACTED@ec2-REDACTED.compute-1.amazonaws.com:REDACTED' -p 'rpjios.sensors.*'`
* [The old now-archived repository](https://github.com/rpj/rpi.archive) from whence this all came
	* might still contain some useful stuff: D3-based "live" analog data plotting code in `rpjctrl`, and I'm still using `ledCount.py` on some of my units because I'm too lazy to re-write it properly
